Project judging criteria
..
-Uniqueness of Solution [better idea]
(a) The use of minimax algorithm is mandatory. Over & above minimax algorithm, can you demonstrate any other approach that yeilds the same result?
(b) Currently, the program plays against a human competitor. Can you change the program in such a way that two humans are able to compete against each other?
(c) Can your program offer suggestion(s) on next move?
(d) Any other unique idea you can think of? Don't restrict yourself to just these examples. Let your creativity go wild! 

-Technical Achivement [The technical documents could include architecture design, flowcharts, or technical specification of your prototype.]

-Code Quality [measure the size, consistency, structure, and complexity of your codebase on GitHub. Your code should work on Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.]

-Relevance to Theme [Stay close to the problem statement]
