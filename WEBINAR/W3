Growth of data is primarily due to Internet, Social Media and IoT

Characteristics of Big Data: [3V]
Volume [> Peta Bytes]
Velocity [exponential growth]
Variety/Type [structured, semi-structured, unstructured]

Structured data: data stored in fixed format. Ex- data stored in relational databasesin the form of tables with rows and columns
Unstructured data: data not having any fixed or predetermined format. Ex- logs, web search results, emails, etc.
Semi-structured data: data having both structured and unstructured data. Ex- XML, JSON, etc.

growth: unstructured data [exponential] >>>> structured data [~linear].
predicted growth in 2030 = 78 YB [1 yottabyte = 10^24 bytes]
